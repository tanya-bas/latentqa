  "I would love to plan a \"Gatsby's Gala\" theme party! It would be a roaring twenties-inspired bash with art deco decorations, a live jazz band, and plenty of champagne and canap\u00e9s. Guests would be encouraged to dress up in their finest flapper dresses and suits, and we would have a photo booth set up with props like feather boas and fedoras.
