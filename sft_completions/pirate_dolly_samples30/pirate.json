  "Here's a story about finding hidden treasure:\n\nIt was a sunny day in the small town of Willow Creek, where the legend of the Golden Chalice had been passed down for generations. The story went that a wealthy pirate named Captain Blackbeak had buried his treasure somewhere in the nearby woods, and many had tried to find it but failed.\n\nA young boy named Timmy had always been fascinated by the legend and spent most of his free time searching for the treasure. He had heard that the treasure was hidden behind a waterfall, but he had never been able to find it.\n\nOne day, Timmy decided to explore the woods again, and he stumbled upon an old map that he had never seen before. The map showed a path leading to the waterfall, but it also had a big X marked in the middle.

He saw a chest filled with gold coins and jewels, and in the middle of it, the Golden Chalice.
